        <p>My love for anything tech-related started at a very young age. I never realized that solving puzzles as my childhood hero, Link, from The Legend of Zelda, would spark my curiosity and instill me with a love for problem-solving. My heart was always on joining the tech industry, but life led me into sales first. While in car sales, I developed skills in managing deadlines, prioritizing tasks, and being able to work with people from any walk of life. I learned the value of being a self-starter, the importance of self-reliance, and when to ask for help or when to "turn the deal" in car lingo. Itâ€™s my unique trajectory that will set me apart from other developers.</p>
